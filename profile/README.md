# NeuralVox

NeuralVox aims to transform public domain books into AI-generated audiobooks and audioplays/dramatic readings.

We currently have MVPs of the following programs (in private repos):

* NeuralVox Catalog: A full-featured audiobook catalog with an AI book recommender
* NeuralVox Audioplay: Create dramatic readings and audioplays from a script using AI

Example of The Raven by Edgar Allan Poe read by TTS: [Listen](https://www.mrfake.name/raven.mp3)

## VoiceFixer 2

We are supporting the [VoiceFixer 2](https://voicefixer.github.io/) project.

## Wait... Where's the catalog?

Sorry! We don't have enough audiobooks so the cost of hosting the catalog isn't worth it. We need **COMPUTE.**

## How Can I Help?

### Do you have access to COMPUTE?

If you have a 3090 or RX6800, unfortunately that won't work. If you have a >4090 (or $$$ for cloud), then THANKS!!! Create an [ISSUE](https://github.com/NeuralVox/.github/issues)!
